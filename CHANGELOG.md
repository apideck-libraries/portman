## v1.6.0 - (2021-07-28)

### Enhancement

### Enhancement

- Phased out "node-fetch" in favour of "Axios" + improved error handling for remote OAS files
- `newmanRunOptions` can now be passed as an object via cli argument `--newmanRunOptions`, or cliOptionsFile. This will be used to extend/overwrite Portmans default Newman options. 🎉

### Temporary fix

- Temporary fix for handling multiple content-types, where the contract will be based on the 1st content-type that is defined in the OpenAPI response.
