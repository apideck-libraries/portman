# Portman üë®üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ

Port OpenAPI Spec to Postman Collection!

Portman sits on top of [@thim81](https://github.com/thim81)'s [open PR](https://github.com/thim81/openapi-to-postman). Tim has made awesome progress in converting an OAS to a Postman Collection with automated test injection. At [Apideck](https://apideck.com), we wanted to include this as part of an automated process that could be injecting directly into our CI/CD pipeline.

With Portman, we can:

- Set Environment variables
- Inject Collection variables
- Inject Pre-Execution Scripts on a collection or request level
- Adjust Request Bodies from spec generated to randomized
- As well as inject tests for each requests that validate:
  - status
  - contenttype
  - jsonbody
  - schema

## Install

1. yarn add -D portman
2. copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add environment variables you need available to your collection.
3. copy/rename and customize each of the \_\_\_\_.example.json config files in the root directory to suit your needs.

- Postman Configuration options can be found [here](https://github.com/thim81/openapi-to-postman/blob/develop/OPTIONS.md)

```

### Environment:

Portman uses `dotenv` to not only access variables for functionality, but you can easily add environment variables that you'd like declared within your postman environment.
Simply prefix any variabled name with `PORTMAN_`, and it will be availble for use in your postman collection as the camelcased equivalent. For example:

```
PORTMAN_CONSUMER_ID=test_user_id
```

will be available in your collection or tests by referencing:

```
{{consumerId}}
```

#### Recommended:

A separate `.env` file lives in the root of your project to hold your `POSTMAN_API_KEY`, but a spec specific `.env` file can live next to your config files, and the path passed in via `envFile` cli option.
This is useful if you have Portman managing multiple specs that have unique environment requirements.

### Config:

To generate the collection with tests, define a JSON file like the example (portman-config.json) below and run the CLI with the --generate option.

```
{
  "preRequestScripts": [
    "pm.collectionVariables.set('statusId', '12345')"
  ],
  "variableOverwrites": {
    "x-apideck-app-id": "{{applicationId}}"
  }
}

```

- **preRequestScripts**: Array of scripts that will be injected as Postman Pre-request Scripts that will execute before every request in this collection.
- **variableOverwrites**: A map of parameter key names that will have their values replaced with the provided Postman variables.

### CLI Options:

- Pass in the remote hosted spec:

```
yarn portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml
```

- Overwrite the baseUrl in spec and run newman.

```
yarn portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -b http://localhost:3050 -n true
```

- Path pass to local data file for newman to use for iterations.

```
yarn portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -b http://localhost:3050 -n true -d ./tmp/newman/data/crm.json
```

- Pass path to a local spec (useful when updating your specs) and output Postman collection locally

```
yarn portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml -o ./tmp/specs/crm.postman.json
```

- Skip tests and just generate collection.

```
yarn portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml -t false
```

- Upload newly generated collection to Postman which will upsert the collection, based on the collection name

```
yarn portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml --syncPostman true
```

Upload newly generated collection to Postman using the collection ID to overwrite the existing.

```
yarn portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml --syncPostman true -p 9601963a-53ff-4aaa-92a0-2e70a8a2a748
```

- Pass custom paths for config files

```
yarn portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -c ./tmp/crm/portman-config.json -g ./tmp/crm/postman-testsuite.json  -s ./common/postman-config.json
```

- Pass all CLI options as JSON file

All the CLI options can be managed in a separate configuration file and passed along to the portman command. This will
make configuration easier, especially in CI/CD implementations.

```
yarn portman --cliOptionsFile ./examples/cli-options/portman-cli-options.json
```

All the available Portman CLI options can be used in the config file.
By passing the CLI options as parameter, you can overwrite the defined CLI options defined in the file.

### Output:

Your generated Postman Collection is written to `./tmp/converted/${specName}.json` if you are manually importing to Postman or need to inspect for debugging.

### To Note:

Newman is set to ignoreRedirects to allow for testing redirect response codes. If you are running collections within Postman UI, you'll need to ensure Postman is set to the same or your redirect tests will fail.

Postman > Preferences > Automatically follow redirects > OFF

### TODO:

- [ ] add task to initalize config files
- [ ] add interactive cli prompts
- [ ] render better error on postman upload fail
- [x] create collection if postman doesn't exist
