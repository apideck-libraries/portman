# Portman üë®üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ

Port OpenAPI Spec to Postman Collection, with contract & variation tests included!

Portman leverages OpenAPI documents, with all its defined API request/response properties, to power your Postman collection.
Let Portman do all the work and inject contract & variation tests with a minimum of configuration.
Customize the Postman requests & variables with a wide range of options to assign & overwrite variables.

## Why use Portman?

Convert your OpenAPI spec to Postman, generate contract & variation tests, upload the Postman collection & run the tests through Newman.
Include the Portman CLI as part of an automated process for injecting the power of Portman directly into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Installation

### Local Installation (recommended)

You can add the Portman CLI to the `node_modules` by using:

```shell
$ npm install --save @apideck/portman
```

or using yarn:

```shell
$ yarn add @apideck/portman
```

Note that this will require you to run the Portman CLI with `npx @apideck/portman -l your-openapi-file.yaml` or, if
you are using an older version of npm, `./node_modules/.bin/portman -l your-openapi-file.yaml`.

### Global Installation

```shell
$ npm install -g @apideck/portman
```

### NPX usage

To execute the CLI without installing it via npm, use the npx method.

```shell
$ npx @apideck/portman -l your-openapi-file.yaml
```

### Environment variables as Postman variables

Portman uses `dotenv` to not only access variables for functionality, but you can also add environment variables that you'd like declared within your Postman environment.
Simply prefix any variable name with `PORTMAN_`, and it will be available for use in your Postman collection as the camel-cased equivalent. For example:

```
PORTMAN_CONSUMER_ID=test_user_id
```

will be available in your collection or tests by referencing:

```
{{consumerId}}
```

It is possible to set a spec-specific `.env` file, that lives next to your config files. The path can be passed in via `envFile` cli option.
This is useful if you have Portman managing multiple specs that have unique environment requirements.

By default, Portman will leverage any ENVIRONMENT variable that is defined that starts with `PORTMAN_`.

### CLI Options

###### Initialize Portman CLI configuration

```
portman --init
```

The `init` option will help you to configure the cliConfig options and put the default config, env file in place to kick-start the usage of Portman.

###### Pass in the remotely hosted spec

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml
```

###### Overwrite the baseUrl in spec and run Newman

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -b http://localhost:3050 -n true
```

###### Path pass to a local data file for Newman to use for iterations

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -b http://localhost:3050 -n true -d ./tmp/newman/data/crm.json
```

###### Pass the path to a local spec (useful when updating your specs) and output Postman collection locally

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml -o ./tmp/specs/crm.postman.json
```

###### Skip tests and just generate collection

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml -t false
```

###### Filter OpenAPI and generate collection

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml --filterFile examples/cli-filtering/oas-format-filter.json
```

For more details, review the [cli-filtering example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/cli-filtering).

###### Upload newly generated collection to Postman, which will upsert the collection, based on the collection name

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml --syncPostman
```

Upload newly generated collection to Postman using the collection UID to overwrite the existing.

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml --syncPostman -p 9601963a-53ff-4aaa-92a0-2e70a8a2a748
```

When a collection gets large, the Postman API will compare all the requests when updating the collection. This can take some time even result in 5xx errors.
To overcome this, you can use the `--postmanFastSync` option. This option will sync your collection to Postman by using "delete" and "create" operations instead of the "update".

REMARK: Using `--postmanFastSync` will result in a new Postman collection and Postman UID for each sync.

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml --syncPostman --postmanFastSync
```

Portman caches a set of Postman API data to facilitate faster lookups and uploads, preventing unnecessary connecting to the Postman API.
In case you need to reset the cache you simply remove the `.portman.cache.json` file or set the `--postmanRefreshCache` option when running the Postman sync.

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml --syncPostman --postmanRefreshCache
```

###### Pass custom paths for config files

All configuration options to convert from OpenAPI to Postman can be on the [openapi-to-postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/openapi-to-postman/blob/develop/OPTIONS.md) package documentation.
Portman provides a default openapi-to-postman configuration [postman-config.default.json](postman-config.default.json), which will be used if no custom config `--postmanConfigFile` is passed.

Portman configuration file in JSON format:

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -c ./tmp/crm/portman-config.json -s ./common/postman-config.json
```

Portman configuration file in YAML format:

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -c ./tmp/crm/portman-config.yaml -s ./common/postman-config.json
```

###### Pass all CLI options as JSON/YAML file

All the CLI options can be managed in a separate configuration file and passed along to the portman command. This will
make configuration easier, especially in CI/CD implementations.

Portman CLI options settings in JSON format

```
portman --cliOptionsFile ./examples/cli-options/portman-cli-options.json
```

Portman CLI options settings in YAML format

```
portman --cliOptionsFile ./examples/cli-options/portman-cli-options.yaml
```

All the available Portman CLI options can be used in the config file.
By passing the CLI options as parameter, you can overwrite the defined CLI options defined in the file.

For more details, review the [cli-options example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/cli-options).

###### Run Newman with Newman options

All [Newman configuration options](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/#options) to run Newman can be passed along through Portman.

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -c ./tmp/crm/portman-config.json --runNewman --newmanOptionsFile ./tmp/crm/newman-options.json
```

For more details, review the [cli-options example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/cli-options).

NOTE: Newman is set to ignore redirects to allow for testing redirect response codes. If you are running collections within Postman UI, you'll need to ensure Postman is set to the same, or your redirect tests will fail.

> Postman > Preferences > Automatically follow redirects > OFF

### Output

Without specifying the output location, your generated Postman Collection is written to `./tmp/converted/${specName}.json` if you are manually importing to Postman or need to inspect for debugging.

By using `-o` or `--output` parameter, you can define the location where the Postman collection will be written.

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml -o ./tmp/specs/crm.Postman.json
```

## Portman settings

The Portman settings consist out of multiple parts:

- **version** : which refers to the JSON Portman configuration version.
- **tests** : which refers to the definitions for the generated contract & variance tests.
  - **contractTests** : refers to the options to enabled autogenerated contract tests.
  - **contentTests** : refers to the additional Postman tests that check the content.
  - **variationTests** : refers to the options to define variation tests.
  - **integrationTests** : refers to the options to define integration tests.
  - **extendTests** : refers to the custom additions of manually created Postman tests.
- **assignVariables** : which refers to setting Postman collection variables for easier automation.
- **overwrites** : which refers to the custom additions/modifications of the OpenAPI/Postman request data.
- **operationPreRequestScripts** : which refers to injecting Postman Pre-request Scripts for requests.
- **globals** : which refers to the customization that applies for the whole Postman collection.

### Portman targeting

It is possible to inject Postman tests and pre-register scripts, assign variables and overwrite query params, headers, request body data with values.

To be able to do this very specifically, there are options to define the targets:

- **openApiOperationId (String)** : References to the OpenAPI operationId, example: `leadsAll`
- **openApiOperationIds (Array)** : References to an array of OpenAPI operationIds, example: `['leadsAll', 'companiesAll', 'contactsAll']`
- **openApiOperation (String)** : References to a combination of the OpenAPI method & path, example: `GET::/crm/leads`

- **excludeForOperations (Array)** : References to OpenAPI operations that will be skipped for targeting. It supports both the `openApiOperationId` and `openApiOperation` format, example: `["leadsAdd", "GET::/crm/leads/{id}"]`

An `openApiOperationId` is an optional property. To offer support for OpenAPI documents that don't have operationIds, we
have added the `openApiOperation` definition, which is the unique combination of the OpenAPI method & path, with a `::`
separator symbol. The targeting option `excludeForOperations` is really useful when using wildcards, to allow exclusions from the wildcard.

This will allow targeting for very specific OpenAPI items.

To facilitate managing the filtering, we have included wildcard options for the `openApiOperation` option, supporting
the methods & path definitions.

REMARK: Be sure to put quotes around the target definition.

- **Strict matching** example: `"openApiOperation": "GET::/crm/leads",`
  This will target only the "GET" method and the specific path "/pets"

- **Method wildcard matching** example: `"openApiOperation": "*::/crm/leads",`
  This will target all methods ('get', 'put', 'post', 'delete', 'options', 'head', 'patch', 'trace') and the specific
  path "/pets"

- **Path wildcard matching** example: `"openApiOperation": "GET::/crm/*"`
  This will target only the "GET" method and any path matching any folder behind the "/pets", like "/pets/123" and
  "/pets/123/buy".

- **Method & Path wildcard matching** example: `"openApiOperation": "*::/crm/*",`
  A combination of wildcards for the method and path parts is even possible.

### Portman - `tests` properties

The Portman `tests` is where you would define the tests that would be applicable and automatically generated by Portman, based on the OpenAPI document.
The contract tests are grouped in an array of `contractTests`.

#### contractTests options

- **openApiOperationId (String)** : References to the OpenAPI operationId. (example: `leadsAll`)
- **openApiOperationIds (Array)** : References to an array of OpenAPI operationIds, example: `['leadsAll', 'companiesAll', 'contactsAll']`
- **openApiOperation (String)** : References to a combination of the OpenAPI method & path (example: `GET::/crm/leads`)
- **excludeForOperations (Array | optional)** : References to OpenAPI operations that will be skipped for targeting, example: `["leadsAdd", "GET::/crm/leads/{id}"]`

- **statusSuccess (Boolean)** : Adds the test if the response of the Postman request returned a 2xx
- **statusCode (Boolean, HTTP code)** : Adds the test if the response of the Postman request return a specific status code.
- **responseTime (Boolean)** : Adds the test to verify if the response of the Postman request is returned within a number of ms.
  - **maxMs (number)** : Define the expected number of ms for the `responseTime` check.
- **contentType (Boolean)** : Adds the test if the response header is matching the expected content-type defined in the OpenAPI spec.
- **jsonBody (Boolean)** : Adds the test if the response body is matching the expected content-type defined in the OpenAPI spec.
- **schemaValidation (Boolean)** : Adds the test if the response body is matching the JSON schema defined in the OpenAPI spec. The JSON schema is inserted inline in the Postman test.
  - **additionalProperties (Boolean)** : Extend the expected JSON schema used for the `schemaValidation` by setting all the `additionalProperties`.
- **headersPresent (Boolean)** : Adds the test to verify if the Postman response header has the header names present, like defined in the OpenAPI spec.

For more details, review the [contract-tests example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/testsuite-contract-tests).

#### variationTests options

- **openApiOperationId (String)** : References to the OpenAPI operationId for which a variation will be created. (example: `leadsAll`)
- **openApiOperationIds (Array)** : References to an array of OpenAPI operationIds, example: `['leadsAll', 'companiesAll', 'contactsAll']`
- **openApiOperation (String)** : References to a combination of the OpenAPI method & path for which a variation will be created. (example: `GET::/crm/leads`)
- **excludeForOperations (Array | optional)** : References to OpenAPI operations that will be skipped for targeting, example: `["leadsAdd", "GET::/crm/leads/{id}"]`
- **openApiResponse (String | optional)** : References to the OpenAPI response object code/name for which a variation will be created. (example: `"404"`). If not defined, the 1st response object from OpenAPI will be taken as expected response. If the configured `openApiResponse` code is not defined in the OpenAPI document, Portman will not generate a variation for the targeted operations.

- **overwrites** : which refers to the custom additions/modifications of the OpenAPI/Postman request data, specifically for the variation.
- **fuzzing** : Fuzz testing sets unexpected values for API requests, to cause unexpected behavior and errors in the API response.
- **tests** : which refers to the definitions for the generated contract & variance tests for the variation.
  - **contractTests** : refers to the options to enabled autogenerated contract tests for the variation.
  - **contentTests** : refers to the additional Postman tests that check the content for the variation.
  - **extendTests** : refers to the custom additions of manual created Postman tests to be included in the variation.
- **assignVariables** : This refers to setting Postman collection variables that are assigned based on variation.

For more details, review the [content-variation example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/testsuite-variation-tests).

#### integrationTests options

- **name (String)** : As Integration tests will normally contain multiple operations, this is the folder name that will be generated in the Integration Tests folder in your Postman collection.
- **operations (Array)** : Array of operations to be performed

### Portman - `contentTests` properties

Content tests will validate if the response property values will match the expected defined values.
While the Portman `tests` verify the "contract" of the API, the `contentTests` will verify the content of the API.

#### contentTests options

For more details, review the [content-tests example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/testsuite-content-tests).

### Portman - `extendTests` properties

When you need to add additional tests or overwrite the Portman-generated test, you can use the `extendTests` to define the raw Postman tests.
Anything added in the `tests` array will be added to the Postman test scripts.

#### extendTests options

- **openApiOperationId (String)** : References to the OpenAPI operationId. (example: `leadsAll`)
- **openApiOperationIds (Array)** : References to an array of OpenAPI operationIds, example: `['leadsAll', 'companiesAll', 'contactsAll']`

### Portman - `fuzzing` properties - BETA üèó

NOTICE: This feature is considered BETA, since we are investigating additional fuzzing capabilities.

> Fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program (a REST API in the case of Portman).

Fuzzing changes the requests (body, query params, ... ) to unexpected values in an effort to cause unexpected behavior and errors in the API response.
For Portman, we want to provide a simple form of Fuzzing, with the goal to trigger validation/error responses, which can be contract tested.
The automatic fuzzing is based on the OpenAPI request properties, where for each fuzzing variation a new Postman request will be generated, with optional contract tests.

The Fuzzing options describe the configuration setting for available OpenAPI fuzzing variations.

REMARKS:

- [Postman Dynamic variables](https://learning.Postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/variables-list/) are rendered before being fuzzed.
- Regular Postman variables are skipped from fuzzing.

#### fuzzing options

- **requestBody (Array)** :

  An array of fuzzing options for the Postman Request Body.

  REMARK: Fuzzing is only applicable for OpenAPI request bodies of media type: "application/json"

  - **requiredFields (Boolean)** : Removes the properties & values from the request body that are marked as "required" in OpenAPI.
  - **minimumNumberFields (Boolean)** : Changes the values of the numeric fields to a lower value than the defined "minimum" property in the OpenAPI document.
  - **maximumNumberFields (Boolean)** : Changes the value of the numeric fields to a lower value than the defined "maximum" property in the OpenAPI document.
  - **minLengthFields (Boolean)** : Changes the length of the value to a lower length than the defined "minLength" property in the OpenAPI document.
  - **maxLengthFields (Boolean)** : Changes the length of the value to a higher length than the defined "maxLength" property in the OpenAPI document.

- **requestQueryParams (Array)** :

  An array of fuzzing options for the Postman Request Query parameters.

  - **requiredFields (Boolean)** : Removes the properties & values from the request query params that are marked as "required" in OpenAPI.
  - **minimumNumberFields (Boolean)** : Changes the values of the numeric fields to a lower value than the defined "minimum" property in the OpenAPI document.
  - **maximumNumberFields (Boolean)** : Changes the value of the numeric fields to a lower value than the defined "maximum" property in the OpenAPI document.
  - **minLengthFields (Boolean)** : Changes the length of the value to a lower length than the defined "minLength" property in the OpenAPI document.

### Portman - `operationPreRequestScripts` properties

The `operationPreRequestScripts` configuration will inject pre-request scripts in the Postman collection, on request level.
Postman executes pre-request scripts before a request runs. If you want to set the Postman Collection pre-request scripts on the collection level, you can use the `globals` > `collectionPreRequestScripts` configuration.
The `operationPreRequestScripts` is inserted on the request level.

#### operationPreRequestScripts options

- **openApiOperationId (String)** : Reference to the OpenAPI operationId on which the "Pre-request Scripts" will be inserted. (example: `leadsAll`)
- **openApiOperationIds (Array)** : References to an array of OpenAPI operationIds, for which the "Pre-request Scripts" will be inserted (example: `['leadsAll', 'companiesAll', 'contactsAll']`
- **openApiOperation (String)** : Reference to combination of the OpenAPI method & path, for which the "Pre-request Scripts" will be inserted (example: `GET::/crm/leads`)
- **excludeForOperations (Array | optional)** : References to OpenAPI operations that will be skipped for targeting. (example: `["leadsAdd", "GET::/crm/leads/{id}"]`)

- **scripts (Array)** : Array of scripts that will be injected as Postman Pre-request Scripts on request level, that will be executed before the targeted requests in this collection. Values can be the script content or path to the script file (with `file:` prefix).

<hr>

### Portman - `globals` property

The configuration defined in the `globals` will be executed on the full Postman collection. This is handy if you need to do mass replacements of variables or specific words/keys/values in the full collection that cannot be overwritten per request.

#### globals options

- **collectionPreRequestScripts** : Array of scripts that will be injected as Postman Collection Pre-request Scripts that will execute before every request in this collection. Values can be the script content or path to the script file (with `file:` prefix).
- **keyValueReplacements** : A map of parameter key names that will have their values replaced with the provided Postman variables.
- **valueReplacements** : A map of values that will have their values replaced with the provided values.
- **rawReplacements** : Consider this a "search & replace" utility, that will search a string/object/... and replace it with another string/object/...
  This is very useful to replace data from the OpenAPI specification, before it is used in the Portman test automation generation.
- **portmanReplacements** : The "search & replace" utility right before the final Postman file is written, that will search a string/object/... and replace it with another string/object/...
  This is practical to replace any data from the generated Portman collection, before it is used in Postman / Newman test execution.
- **orderOfOperations** : The `orderOfOperations` is a list of OpenAPI operations, which is used by Portman to sort the Postman requests in the desired order, in their folder. Items that are **not** defined in the `orderOfOperations` list will remain at their current order.
- **stripResponseExamples (Boolean | optional)** : Strip the response examples from the generated Postman collection.
- **securityOverwrites** : Overwrite of the OpenAPI Security Scheme Object (supported types: "apiKey", "http basic auth", "http bearer token") or inject a Postman authorization option (supported types: awsv4, digest, edgegrid, ntlm, oauth1, oauth2) on a collection level. 

The security overwrites provides a number of security types:

- **apiKey**: The API key auth will send a key-value pair to the API either in the request headers or query parameters.
  - **value (String)** : The value that will be inserted as the Postman apiKey value. It can be a plain value or a Postman variable.
  - **key (String | optional)** : The "key" value that will be inserted in the Postman apiKey key field. It can be a plain value or a Postman variable.
  - **in (String | optional)** : The "in" value that defines where the Api Key will be added in the Postman request Header or Query params. Postman supports `header` for "Header" or `query` for "Query Params".

```json
"securityOverwrites": {
      "apiKey": {
        "value": "{{apiKey}}"
      }
    }
```

- **bearer**: The bearer tokens allow requests to authenticate using an access key, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT).
  - **token (String)** : The "token" that will be inserted as the Postman bearer token value. It can be a plain value or a Postman variable.

```json
"securityOverwrites": {
      "bearer": {
        "token": "{{bearerToken}}"
      }
    }
```

- **basic**: Basic authentication involves sending a verified username and password with your request.
  - **username (String)** : The username that will be inserted as the basic authentication username value
  - **password (String)** : The password that will be inserted as the basic authentication password value

```json
"securityOverwrites": {
      "basic": {
        "username": "{{username}}",
        "password": "{{password}}",
      }
    }
```

- **Postman security options**: Overwrite/Insert Postman authorization settings.
  - **Postman Type (Array)** : The Postman authorization option type. Supported types are: `awsv4`, `digest`, `edgegrid`, `ntlm`, `oauth1`, `oauth2`
    - **Attributes** : key/value/type as defined in Postman (the easiest way to define it, is to set it manually in Postman, export the collection and extract the matching values from the JSON file). 

```json
{
  "globals": {
    "securityOverwrites": {
      "oauth1": [
        {
          "key": "addEmptyParamsToSign",
          "value": true,
          "type": "boolean"
        },
        {
          "key": "timestamp",
          "value": "1461319769",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "nonce",
          "value": "ik3oT5",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "consumerSecret",
          "value": "D+EdQ-gs$-%@2Nu7",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "consumerKey",
          "value": "RKCGzna7bv9YD57c",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "signatureMethod",
          "value": "HMAC-SHA1",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "version",
          "value": "1.0",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "addParamsToHeader",
          "value": false,
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Configure automatic upload to Postman App

> REMARK: Portman does **not** require you to have a Postman account.

In case you want to sync the generated Postman collection with the Postman app (`portman --syncPostman`), you would need a Postman account since Portman leverages the Postman API to sync the collection.

This can be a "free" Postman account or any of the paid [Postman plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

The generated Postman collection can always be [imported manually](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-data-into-postman), without a Postman account.

To enable automatic uploads of the generated Postman collection through Portman, follow these steps:

1. Get your Postman API key

![Documentation Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apideck-libraries/portman/main/docs/img/postman-automation-0.png)

![Documentation Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apideck-libraries/portman/main/docs/img/postman-automation-1.png)

![Documentation Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apideck-libraries/portman/main/docs/img/postman-automation-2.png)

2. Goto the root folder of your project

3. Copy [env-postman-app-example](./.env-postman-app.example) as `.env` in the root folder of your project

4. Enter your Postman API key in a local `.env` file, as `POSTMAN_API_KEY=[replace with Postman api key]`

Next to the Postman API key, you can also pass along the Postman Workspace name & the specific Postman Collection UID.

Supported Postman API .ENV variables:

- **POSTMAN_API_KEY** : Postman API key
- **POSTMAN_WORKSPACE_NAME** : Postman Workspace name to target the upload of the generated Postman collection
- **POSTMAN_COLLECTION_UID** : Postman collection UID to upload with the generated Postman collection

The `POSTMAN_WORKSPACE_NAME` & `POSTMAN_COLLECTION_UID` variables can also be set as CLI Options `--postmanWorkspaceName` & `--postmanUid` , which will overrule the variables defined in the .ENV file.

> **RECOMMENDATION**: Do not commit the `.env` file in any versioning system like GIT if it contains confidential credentials.

# Credits

Portman started as a PR on the handy [openapi-to-postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/openapi-to-postman) package to generate basic Postman tests from the OpenAPI specification.

[Apideck](https://www.apideck.com/) immediately saw the PR's value and collaborated with the original author, [Tim Haselaars](https://github.com/thim81), to adopt the functionality and extend the options & tooling to create "Portman".

The goal of Portman is to drive API automation by 'porting' a static OpenAPI document to a dynamic Postman collection that includes a powerful testing suite with variable requests, bodies and more. All this while being easy to configure & ready to use.

Portman is a valuable tool in any OpenAPI workflow, for local development or as part of a CI/CD automation pipeline.
