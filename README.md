## Getting started

1. Install Portman
2. Initialize Portman CLI configuration through the command: `$ portman --init`

OR

1. Install Portman
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add environment variables you need available to your collection.
3. Copy/rename and customize each of the \_\_\_\_.default.json config files in the root directory to suit your needs.
4. Start converting your OpenAPI document to Postman

All configuration options to convert from OpenAPI to Postman can be on the [openapi-to-postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/openapi-to-postman/blob/develop/OPTIONS.md) package documentation.

## Installation

### Local Installation (recommended)

You can add the Portman CLI to the `node_modules` by using:

```shell
$ npm install --save @apideck/portman
```

or using yarn...

```shell
$ yarn add @apideck/portman
```

Note that this will require you to run the Portman CLI with `npx @apideck/portman -l your-openapi-file.yaml` or, if
you are using an older version of npm, `./node_modules/.bin/Portman -l your-openapi-file.yaml`.

### Global Installation

```shell
$ npm install -g @apideck/portman
```

### NPX usage

To execute the CLI without installing it via npm, use the npx method.

```shell
$ npx @apideck/portman -l your-openapi-file.yaml
```

```

### Environment variables as Postman variables

Portman uses `dotenv` to not only access variables for functionality, but you can easily add environment variables that you'd like declared within your Postman environment.
Simply prefix any variable name with `PORTMAN_`, and it will be available for use in your Postman collection as the camel-cased equivalent. For example:

```
PORTMAN_CONSUMER_ID=test_user_id
```

will be available in your collection or tests by referencing:

```
{{consumerId}}
```

It is possible to set a spec-specific `.env` file, that lives next to your config files. The path can be passed in via `envFile` cli option.
This is useful if you have Portman managing multiple specs that have unique environment requirements.

By default, Portman will leverage any ENVIRONMENT variable that is defined that starts with `PORTMAN_`.

### CLI Options

- Initialize Portman CLI configuration:

```
portman --init
```

The `init` option will help you to configure the cliConfig options and put the default config, env file in place to kick-start the usage of Portman.

- Pass in the remotely hosted spec:

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml
```

- Overwrite the baseUrl in spec and run Newman.

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -b http://localhost:3050 -n true
```

- Path pass to a local data file for Newman to use for iterations.

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -b http://localhost:3050 -n true -d ./tmp/newman/data/crm.json
```

- Pass the path to a local spec (useful when updating your specs) and output Postman collection locally

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml -o ./tmp/specs/crm.Postman.json
```

- Skip tests and just generate collection.

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml -t false
```

- Upload newly generated collection to Postman, which will upsert the collection, based on the collection name

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml --syncPostman true
```

Upload newly generated collection to Postman using the collection ID to overwrite the existing.

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml --syncPostman true -p 9601963a-53ff-4aaa-92a0-2e70a8a2a748
```

- Pass custom paths for config files

All configuration options to convert from OpenAPI to Postman can be on the [openapi-to-postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/openapi-to-postman/blob/develop/OPTIONS.md) package documentation.
Portman provides a default openapi-to-postman configuration [postman-config.default.json](postman-config.default.json), which will be used if no custom config `--postmanConfigFile` is passed.

```
portman -u https://specs.apideck.com/crm.yml -c ./tmp/crm/portman-config.json -s ./common/postman-config.json
```

- Pass all CLI options as JSON file

All the CLI options can be managed in a separate configuration file and passed along to the portman command. This will
make configuration easier, especially in CI/CD implementations.

```
portman --cliOptionsFile ./examples/cli-options/portman-cli-options.json
```

All the available Portman CLI options can be used in the config file.
By passing the CLI options as parameter, you can overwrite the defined CLI options defined in the file.

For more details, review the [cli-options example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/cli-options).

### Output

Without specifying the output location, your generated Postman Collection is written to `./tmp/converted/${specName}.json` if you are manually importing to Postman or need to inspect for debugging.

By using `-o` or `--output` parameter, you can define the location where the Postman collection will be written.

```
portman -l ./tmp/specs/crm.yml -o ./tmp/specs/crm.Postman.json
```

### To Note:

Newman is set to ignore redirects to allow for testing redirect response codes. If you are running collections within Postman UI, you'll need to ensure Postman is set to the same, or your redirect tests will fail.

Postman > Preferences > Automatically follow redirects > OFF

## Portman settings

The Portman settings consist out of multiple parts:

- **version** : which refers to the JSON Portman configuration version.
- **tests** : which refers to the definitions for the generated contract & variance tests.
  - **contractTests** : refers to the options to enabled autogenerated contract tests.
  - **contentTests** : refers to the additional Postman tests that check the content.
  - **variationTests** : refers to the options to define variation tests.
  - **extendTests** : refers to the custom additions of manually created Postman tests.
- **assignVariables** : which refers to setting Postman collection variables for easier automation.
- **overwrites** : which refers to the custom additions/modifications of the OpenAPI/Postman request data.
- **globals** : which refers to the customization that applies for the whole Postman collection.

### Portman targeting

It is possible to inject Postman tests and pre-register scripts, assign variables and overwrite query params, headers, request body data with values.

To be able to do this very specifically, there are options to define the targets:

- **openApiOperationId (String)** : References to the OpenAPI operationId, example: `leadsAll`
- **openApiOperationIds (Array)** : References to an array of OpenAPI operationIds, example: `['leadsAll', 'companiesAll', 'contactsAll']`
- **openApiOperation (String)** : References to a combination of the OpenAPI method & path, example: `GET::/crm/leads`

- **excludeForOperations (Array)** : References to OpenAPI operations that will be skipped for targeting. It supports both the `openApiOperationId` and `openApiOperation` format, example: `["leadsAdd", "GET::/crm/leads/{id}"]`

An `openApiOperationId` is an optional property. To offer support for OpenAPI documents that don't have operationIds, we
have added the `openApiOperation` definition, which is the unique combination of the OpenAPI method & path, with a `::`
separator symbol. The targeting option `excludeForOperations` is really useful when using wildcards, to allow exclusions from the wildcard.

This will allow targeting for very specific OpenAPI items.

To facilitate managing the filtering, we have included wildcard options for the `openApiOperation` option, supporting
the methods & path definitions.

REMARK: Be sure to put quotes around the target definition.

- **Strict matching** example: `"openApiOperation": "GET::/crm/leads",`
  This will target only the "GET" method and the specific path "/pets"

- **Method wildcard matching** example: `"openApiOperation": "*::/crm/leads",`
  This will target all methods ('get', 'put', 'post', 'delete', 'options', 'head', 'patch', 'trace') and the specific
  path "/pets"

- **Path wildcard matching** example: `"openApiOperation": "GET::/crm/*"`
  This will target only the "GET" method and any path matching any folder behind the "/pets", like "/pets/123" and
  "/pets/123/buy".

- **Method & Path wildcard matching** example: `"openApiOperation": "*::/crm/*",`
  A combination of wildcards for the method and path parts is even possible.

### Portman - `tests` properties

The Portman `tests` is where you would define the tests that would be applicable and automatically generated by Portman, based on the OpenAPI document.
The contract tests are grouped in an array of `contractTests`.

#### contractTests options

### Portman - `extendTests` properties

When you need to add additional tests or overwrite the Portman-generated test, you can use the `extendTests` to define the raw Postman tests.
Anything added in the `tests` array will be added to the Postman test scripts.

#### extendTests options

- **openApiOperationId (String)** : References to the OpenAPI operationId. (example: `leadsAll`)
- **openApiOperationIds (Array)** : References to an array of OpenAPI operationIds, example: `['leadsAll', 'companiesAll', 'contactsAll']`

### Portman - `globals` property

The configuration defined in the `globals` will be executed on the full Postman collection. This is handy if you need to do mass replacements of variables or specific words/keys/values in the full collection that cannot be overwritten per request.

#### globals options

- **collectionPreRequestScripts** : Array of scripts that will be injected as Postman Collection Pre-request Scripts that will execute before every request in this collection.
- **keyValueReplacements** : A map of parameter key names that will have their values replaced with the provided Postman variables.
- **valueReplacements** : A map of values that will have their values replaced with the provided values.
- **rawReplacements** : Consider this a "search & replace" utility, that will search a string/object/... and replace it with another string/object/...
  This is very useful to replace data from the OpenAPI specification to be used in the Postman test automation.
- **orderOfOperations** : The `orderOfOperations` is a list of OpenAPI operations, which is used by Portman to sort the Postman requests in the desired order, in their folder. Items that are **not** defined in the `orderOfOperations` list will remain at their current order.

For more details, review the [globals example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/portman-globals) and [ordering example](https://github.com/apideck-libraries/portman/tree/main/examples/postman-ordering)

## Configure automatic upload to Postman App

To enable automatic uploads of the generated Postman collection through Portman, follow these simple steps:

1. Get your Postman API key

![Documentation Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apideck-libraries/portman/main/docs/img/postman-automation-0.png)

![Documentation Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apideck-libraries/portman/main/docs/img/postman-automation-1.png)

![Documentation Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apideck-libraries/portman/main/docs/img/postman-automation-2.png)

2. Goto the root folder of your project

3. Copy `./env-postman-app-example` as `.env` in the root folder of

4. Enter your Postman API key in your local `.env`

It is recommended to put a separate `.env` file lives in the root of your project to hold your `POSTMAN_API_KEY`.
Do not commit this `.env` in any version systems like GIT since it contains credentials.

# Credits

Portman started as a PR on the handy [openapi-to-postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/openapi-to-postman) package to generate basic Postman tests from the OpenAPI specification.

[Apideck](https://www.apideck.com/) immediately saw the PR's value and collaborated with the original author, [Tim Haselaars](https://github.com/thim81), to adopt the functionality and extend the options & tooling to create "Portman".

The goal of Portman is to drive API automation by 'porting' a static OpenAPI document to a dynamic Postman collection that includes a powerful testing suite with variable requests, bodies and more. All this while being easy to configure & ready to use.

Portman is a valuable tool in any OpenAPI workflow, for local development or as part of a CI/CD automation pipeline.

Credits for this package for the hard work of [Nick Lloyd](https://github.com/nicklloyd) and [Tim Haselaars](https://github.com/thim81).

# Future ideas

- [ ] add task to initialize config files
- [ ] add interactive cli prompts
- [ ] render better error on Postman upload fail
- [ ] cache the Postman collection lookup during Postman upload
